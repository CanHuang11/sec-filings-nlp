Make sure download the [metadata.sqlite3](link.database) and [sec_reports.zip](link.file) files first and store/extract both files into this folder. The size of all reports is about 1.65 GB (compressed). Alternatively, you can also retrieve the latest data from SEC with [SEC-EDGAR-text](https://github.com/alions7000/SEC-EDGAR-text).
